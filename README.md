# MigotoQT
## App writen in PyQt5
## Makefile contains a lot of useful command (tested in wsl):
- ``make gen``: generates .py files from .ui
- ``make run``: runs the application
- ``make update-deps``: freeze deps in requirments.txt
- ``make setup-venv``: doesn't work for me, but command reminds me how to enter venv)
